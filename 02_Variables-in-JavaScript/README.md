# Variables in JavaScript

In JavaScript, variables are used to store data values. Variables act as named storage for data, and their values can be retrieved or changed during program execution. Here’s an overview of variables in JavaScript, including rules for naming them and examples from your provided code.

## Types of Variables
JavaScript variables can be declared in three ways:

1. **Using `let` keyword:** Allows you to declare block-scoped variables that can be updated but not re-declared within the same scope.
   ```javascript
   let firstname = 'Ritik';
   let age = 23;
   ```

2. **Using `const` keyword:** Used to declare block-scoped constants whose values cannot be reassigned.
   ```javascript
   const pi = 3.14;
   ```

3. **Using `var` keyword:** Declares function-scoped variables and allows re-declarations. This is considered outdated and is rarely used in modern JavaScript.
   ```javascript
   var lastname = 'Raj';
   ```

## Rules for Naming Variables
- Variable names can contain:
  - **Letters:** Both uppercase (`A-Z`) and lowercase (`a-z`).
  - **Digits:** (`0-9`), but the name cannot start with a digit.
  - **Special characters:** `$` and `_` are allowed.
- Variable names are **case-sensitive**.
- Reserved words (e.g., `let`, `class`) cannot be used as variable names.

Example from your code:
```javascript
let firstname = 'Ritik';
let lastname = 'Raj';
let age = 23;
let ishappy = true;
let userIntro = 'My name is ' + firstname + ' ' + lastname + '. I am ' + age + ' years old.';
```

## Key Notes:
1. **`let` and `const` are block-scoped,** meaning their visibility is restricted to the block where they are defined.
2. **`var` is function-scoped,** meaning it is accessible throughout the function where it is declared.
3. Always prefer `let` and `const` over `var` for better code clarity and scope handling.

## Interview Questions on Variables in JavaScript

1. **What are the different ways to declare variables in JavaScript? Explain their differences.**
   - `var`: Function-scoped, allows re-declaration, and is hoisted.
   - `let`: Block-scoped, doesn’t allow re-declaration within the same scope, and is hoisted but not initialized.
   - `const`: Block-scoped, must be initialized at the time of declaration, and cannot be reassigned.

2. **What is variable hoisting in JavaScript?**
   - Variable hoisting refers to the process where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     console.log(x); // undefined
     var x = 5;
     ```

3. **Can a variable declared with `const` be updated?**
   - No, the value of a `const` variable cannot be reassigned. However, if the `const` holds an object, the object’s properties can be updated.
     ```javascript
     const user = { name: 'Ritik' };
     user.name = 'Raj'; // Allowed
     ```

4. **What happens if you try to access a variable before declaring it?**
   - If declared with `var`: It will return `undefined` due to hoisting.
   - If declared with `let` or `const`: It will throw a `ReferenceError`.

5. **Explain the difference between `let` and `var`.**
   - `let` is block-scoped, while `var` is function-scoped.
   - `let` does not allow re-declaration within the same scope, whereas `var` does.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     if (true) {
       let x = 10;
       var y = 20;
     }
     console.log(y); // 20
     console.log(x); // ReferenceError
     ```

6. **Why should you avoid using `var` in modern JavaScript?**
   - `var` lacks block-scoping, which can lead to unexpected behaviors and bugs. `let` and `const` provide better control over variable scope and reduce errors.

7. **What is the temporal dead zone (TDZ) in JavaScript?**
   - The TDZ is the period between entering a block and declaring a variable where accessing the variable will throw a `ReferenceError`.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     console.log(x); // ReferenceError
     let x = 5;
     ```

8. **Can you re-declare a variable in the same scope with `var`, `let`, or `const`?**
   - `var`: Yes
   - `let`: No
   - `const`: No

9. **What are global variables in JavaScript? How can you create one?**
   - Global variables are accessible throughout the entire program.
   - Created by declaring a variable outside any function or by omitting the `let`, `const`, or `var` keyword (not recommended).
     ```javascript
     globalVar = 'Accessible everywhere'; // Avoid this!
     ```

10. **What’s the difference between declaring variables inside and outside a function?**
    - Variables declared inside a function are local to that function.
    - Variables declared outside a function have global scope.
