# Event-Loop and Callback Queue in JavaScript

## Overview

In JavaScript, the event loop is an essential part of the language's concurrency model. It allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations, like handling I/O, even though JavaScript is single-threaded. The event loop works in conjunction with the **callback queue** to execute asynchronous code.

This README explains the workings of the event loop and the callback queue in JavaScript, providing a detailed understanding of how asynchronous code is handled.

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Call Stack**
   The **call stack** is where the JavaScript engine keeps track of function calls. When a function is called, it is added to the call stack. When the function finishes execution, it is removed from the call stack.

### 2. **Callback Queue (or Message Queue)**
   The **callback queue** holds functions that are ready to be executed after the current execution context is cleared. These functions are typically the result of asynchronous operations, such as `setTimeout()`, AJAX requests, or event listeners.

### 3. **Event Loop**
   The **event loop** is responsible for continuously checking if the call stack is empty. If it is empty and there are tasks in the callback queue, the event loop moves the oldest task from the queue to the call stack for execution.

### 4. **Web APIs**
   Web APIs are provided by the browser (or Node.js) to handle asynchronous tasks. They include functions like `setTimeout`, DOM events, or AJAX requests. These APIs handle tasks asynchronously and place the corresponding callback functions into the callback queue.

## Workflow

The event loop works in the following steps:

1. The call stack executes synchronous code, which is placed there by the JavaScript engine.
2. If an asynchronous operation is encountered, it is sent to the Web APIs for handling (e.g., `setTimeout`, `fetch`).
3. Once the asynchronous operation is completed, its callback is placed in the callback queue.
4. The event loop continuously checks if the call stack is empty.
5. If the call stack is empty, the event loop moves the first callback from the callback queue to the call stack.
6. The callback function is executed from the call stack.

## Example

Here’s a simple example to visualize the event loop and callback queue:

```javascript
console.log('Start');

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('Middle');
}, 0);

console.log('End');
```

### Expected Output:
```
Start
End
Middle
```

**Explanation:**
1. `'Start'` is printed immediately as it’s part of the main thread.
2. The `setTimeout()` function schedules its callback function to be executed after 0 milliseconds, but it is placed in the callback queue, not the call stack.
3. `'End'` is printed immediately after `'Start'`.
4. The event loop then checks the call stack (which is empty) and moves the `setTimeout` callback to the call stack for execution, printing `'Middle'`.

## Conclusion

Understanding the event loop and callback queue is crucial for writing efficient, non-blocking JavaScript code. It allows you to better manage asynchronous operations, improving your application's performance and responsiveness.
