# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript 🚀

![OOP Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/OOP-JavaScript-blue?style=flat&logo=javascript)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. In JavaScript, OOP allows you to structure your code into reusable and modular components. This guide explains the key concepts of OOP in JavaScript with examples to help you better understand the subject.

## Key Concepts of OOP

### 1. **Classes and Objects** 🎯

In OOP, a **class** is a blueprint for creating objects. **Objects** are instances of a class. Classes define properties (attributes) and methods (behaviors) that an object can use.

#### Example Code:
```javascript
// Class definition
class Car {
    constructor(make, model, year) {
        this.make = make;
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
    }

    displayInfo() {
        return `${this.year} ${this.make} ${this.model}`;
    }
}

// Creating an object (instance) from the class
const myCar = new Car('Toyota', 'Camry', 2020);
console.log(myCar.displayInfo());  // Output: 2020 Toyota Camry
```

#### Explanation:
- The `Car` class defines the structure of a car, with properties such as `make`, `model`, and `year`.
- The `displayInfo` method is used to return a string with the car's details.
- `myCar` is an **object** (instance) of the `Car` class. When we call `myCar.displayInfo()`, it outputs the car's full information.

### 2. **Encapsulation** 🔒

**Encapsulation** refers to the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit, or class. It also involves restricting direct access to some of the object's components, which is done using private fields and methods.

#### Example Code:
```javascript
class BankAccount {
    #balance;  // Private property

    constructor(owner, balance) {
        this.owner = owner;
        this.#balance = balance;  // Private balance
    }

    deposit(amount) {
        this.#balance += amount;
        console.log(`Deposited $${amount}. New balance: $${this.#balance}`);
    }

    getBalance() {
        return this.#balance;
    }
}

const myAccount = new BankAccount('John Doe', 1000);
myAccount.deposit(500);  // Deposited $500. New balance: $1500
console.log(myAccount.getBalance());  // Output: 1500
```

#### Explanation:
- The `BankAccount` class has a private `#balance` property that cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.
- The `deposit` method modifies the `#balance` securely, ensuring that the balance can only be changed via methods provided by the class.
- The `getBalance` method allows us to safely retrieve the balance value.

By hiding the balance inside the class and using methods to interact with it, we prevent unauthorized access or changes to the sensitive data.

### 3. **Inheritance** 🧬

**Inheritance** is a mechanism in OOP that allows one class (child class) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent class). This promotes code reuse and helps create a hierarchy of classes.

#### Example Code:
```javascript
class Animal {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    speak() {
        console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound.`);
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    speak() {
        console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);
    }
}

const dog = new Dog('Buddy');
dog.speak();  // Output: Buddy barks.
```

#### Explanation:
- The `Animal` class has a `speak` method that outputs a generic message.
- The `Dog` class **inherits** from `Animal` and overrides the `speak` method to provide a specific implementation for dogs (i.e., barking).
- By using inheritance, we avoid writing the same `speak` method in multiple classes and instead extend the parent class to reuse its behavior.

---

### 4. **Polymorphism** 🔄

**Polymorphism** allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It also means that methods can be redefined in derived classes. This enables different behaviors to be invoked using the same method name.

#### Example Code:
```javascript
class Shape {
    area() {
        return 0;
    }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    constructor(radius) {
        super();  // Calls the parent class constructor
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    area() {
        return Math.PI * this.radius * this.radius;
    }
}

class Square extends Shape {
    constructor(side) {
        super();
        this.side = side;
    }

    area() {
        return this.side * this.side;
    }
}

const circle = new Circle(5);
console.log(circle.area());  // Output: 78.53981633974483

const square = new Square(4);
console.log(square.area());  // Output: 16
```

#### Explanation:
- The `Shape` class defines a generic `area` method that returns `0`.
- The `Circle` and `Square` classes override the `area` method to provide their own implementation for calculating the area.
- This demonstrates **polymorphism** since both `Circle` and `Square` override the `area` method, and we can call the same method on different objects to get different results.

### 5. **Abstraction** 🕵️‍♂️

**Abstraction** involves hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. This makes interacting with objects easier without worrying about the underlying details.

#### Example Code:
```javascript
class CoffeeMachine {
    brewCoffee() {
        this.boilWater();
        this.brewGrounds();
        this.pourInCup();
    }

    boilWater() {
        console.log("Boiling water...");
    }

    brewGrounds() {
        console.log("Brewing coffee grounds...");
    }

    pourInCup() {
        console.log("Pouring coffee into cup...");
    }
}

const coffeeMachine = new CoffeeMachine();
coffeeMachine.brewCoffee();
```

#### Explanation:
- The `CoffeeMachine` class abstracts away the detailed steps of making coffee (boiling water, brewing grounds, pouring into a cup).
- The `brewCoffee` method exposes a simple interface to make coffee. The user doesn't need to know how the coffee is made, just that they need to call `brewCoffee()` to get the result.
- By using abstraction, the complexity of the process is hidden, and we only expose what's necessary.

### 6. **Static Methods** 🧑‍💻

**Static methods** belong to the class itself, not to instances of the class. They are useful for performing operations that don't depend on instance data.

#### Example Code:
```javascript
class MathUtil {
    static add(a, b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    static multiply(a, b) {
        return a * b;
    }
}

console.log(MathUtil.add(2, 3));  // Output: 5
console.log(MathUtil.multiply(2, 3));  // Output: 6
```

#### Explanation:
- The `MathUtil` class has two **static methods**, `add` and `multiply`, that perform basic arithmetic operations.
- Static methods are accessed directly on the class, without needing to create an object.
- This is useful for utility functions that don't require access to object-specific data.

### 7. **Getters and Setters** 🎯

**Getters and Setters** are special methods that allow controlled access to an object's properties. A getter method retrieves a property’s value, while a setter method modifies it.

#### Example Code:
```javascript
class Rectangle {
    constructor(width, height) {
        this._width = width;  // _ denotes internal use
        this._height = height;
    }

    get area() {
        return this._width * this._height;
    }

    set width(value) {
        if (value > 0) this._width = value;
    }

    set height(value) {
        if (value > 0) this._height = value;
    }
}

const rect = new Rectangle(5, 10);
console.log(rect.area);  // Output: 50
rect.width = 7;
console.log(rect.area);  // Output: 70
```

#### Explanation:
- The `Rectangle` class defines private properties `_width` and `_height`, and uses **getters** and **setters** to access and modify them.
- The `area` property is a getter that calculates the area of the rectangle.
- Setters for `width` and `height` ensure that the values remain positive when modified.

## Benefits of OOP 🏆

- **Maintainability**: OOP helps organize your code into modular units, making it easier to update and maintain over time.
- **Reusability**: You can reuse classes and objects in different parts of your code, reducing duplication.
- **Scalability**: OOP enables you to easily extend your code by adding new classes and objects, making it scalable as your application grows.
- **Readability**: OOP makes your code more readable by organizing it into logical units that represent real-world objects and behaviors.

## Conclusion 🌈

Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript provides a powerful way to structure and organize your code. By using concepts like classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, you can create modular, reusable, and maintainable applications. Mastering OOP will give you the tools to handle more complex programming challenges with ease.
