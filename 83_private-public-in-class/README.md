# Public and Private Properties in JavaScript Classes

## Overview

This document explains the concept of public and private properties in JavaScript classes. We'll explore the usage of `#` syntax to create private properties, as well as the difference between public and private properties using examples from the provided `CreateUser` class.

## Key Concepts

- **Public Properties**: These are properties that can be accessed directly from an instance of the class.
- **Private Properties**: These are properties that are only accessible within the class itself. They cannot be accessed from outside the class, ensuring data encapsulation and integrity.

In JavaScript, private properties are introduced using the `#` syntax. This feature was added in ES2022 (ECMAScript 2022) to make properties truly private within a class.

## Code Explanation

### CreateUser Class

```javascript
class CreateUser {
    #age // Private property

    constructor(firstName, lastName, age) {
        this.firstName = firstName; // Public property
        this.lastName = lastName; // Public property
        this.#age = age; // Private property
    }

    #h1 = "Hello World"; // Another private property

    // Public method
    getBirthYear() {
        console.log(this.#h1); // Accessing private property within the class
        console.log(this.#getFullName()); // Accessing private method
        return new Date().getFullYear() - this.#age; // Using private property
    }

    // Private method
    #getFullName() {
        return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Class Structure

1. **Private Property (`#age`)**:
    - The `#age` property is marked private using the `#` symbol. This means it cannot be accessed directly from outside the class, making it a truly private property.
    - Example: `const user1 = new CreateUser('Ritik', 'Raj', 24); user1.#age; // Error: Private field '#age' must be declared in an enclosing class`.

2. **Public Properties**:
    - `firstName` and `lastName` are public properties. They can be accessed directly from an instance of the class.
    - Example: `console.log(user1.firstName); // "Ritik"`

3. **Private Method (`#getFullName`)**:
    - The `#getFullName` method is private, and it can only be called within the class. Attempting to call this method outside the class will result in an error.
    - Example: `user1.#getFullName(); // Error: Private method '#getFullName' must be declared in an enclosing class`.

4. **Public Method (`getBirthYear`)**:
    - The `getBirthYear` method is a public method that calculates the birth year of the user based on the `#age` private property and also calls the private `#getFullName` method.
    - This method demonstrates how private properties and methods can be accessed within a public method of the same class.

### Example Usage

```javascript
const user1 = new CreateUser('Ritik', 'Raj', 24);
const user2 = new CreateUser('Kirti', 'Raikar', 25);

console.log(user1.getBirthYear()); // Accessing public method that internally uses private properties and methods.
```

### Public Object with Private-like Property

```javascript
const a = {
    name: "Ritik Raj",
    '#age': 24 // This is not truly private because it can be accessed directly using brackets: a['#age']
};

console.log(a['#age']); // 24
```

Although `#age` is intended to be private, in this case, it's not truly private because it's just a regular property name with the `#` symbol. The `#` in this object does not have the same effect as in classes. The property can be accessed directly, showing that it's not a true private field.

### Private vs. Public

#### Public:

- Public properties and methods are accessible from outside the class.
- They are not protected by any encapsulation, meaning they can be modified or read freely.

#### Private:

- Private properties and methods are strictly confined to the class and cannot be accessed or modified from outside.
- This helps in creating more secure and predictable code by preventing accidental changes to critical data.

## Summary

- **Private properties and methods** are declared using the `#` symbol and are only accessible inside the class.
- **Public properties and methods** are declared normally and can be accessed directly from instances of the class.
- This encapsulation helps improve security, reduces the risk of accidental modifications, and provides cleaner code.

By using private fields and methods, we can ensure that only authorized code within the class has access to critical information.
